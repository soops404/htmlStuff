                <h2>They left him with one desire and nothing more to lose.</h2>
                <p>What starts as a simple revenge trope goes off-track when the guy gets conflicted about killing. Dang, I hate it when that happens. Revenge, the nature of justice, and learning to move on. Scott Springer writing as Clyde McCall explores his signature themes of family and the lone hero, his modern day American Cowboy.</p>
                <p>Carl lives the simple life in the woods with his perfect family, a loving wife and two adoring kids, until evil destroys all he breathes for in a fit of bloody rage.</p>

                    <p>Everyone knows who did it, but none dare question the powerful.</p>
                    <p>The five stages of grief and loss are denial, anger, and . . . Carl is stalled firmly in anger. There will be no acceptance until blood spills. To Carl, the one stage of dealing with grief is vengeance.</p>
                    <h2>Carl licked dirt, but soon he’ll taste blood.</h2>
                    <p>The bible says turn the other cheek, but Carl says eye for an eye. Unafraid to die, he pursues his murderous justice.</p>
                    <p>This small-town thriller pays homage to the pulp tradition with its fast pace and plenty of action. But it is also a thoughtful novel on what it means to achieve justice move forward. </p>
