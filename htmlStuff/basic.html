				LET us go then, you and I,	
				When the evening is spread out against the sky	
				Like a patient etherized upon a table;	
				Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,	
				The muttering retreats
				Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels	
				And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:	
				Streets that follow like a tedious argument	
				Of insidious intent	
				To lead you to an overwhelming question….
				Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”	
				Let us go and make our visit.
			</p>
		<!--	<hr>  -->

				The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,	   
				The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes	
				Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,	
				Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,	
				Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,	
				Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,	   
				And seeing that it was a soft October night,	
				Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				In the room the women come and go	
				Talking of Michelangelo.
