               <p>Welcome to my brand new website. Don't mind the construction workers. I know I don't.</p>
               <p>So yeah, about me. I'm an artist chic. Got a loft and love morning light. You know, a messed up artist chic. In my pain is your pleasure. Yup, daddy issues, in a willing way.</p>
               <p>While I'm getting my act together, preparing to bring you some solid excietment in published word form, I have an offer for you.</p>
               <p>But first, who is Erica really?  That's easy.  I'm a keyboard whore. My words are my fingers. Need I say more?</p>

               <h2>Here's the deal.</h2>
               <p>You, give me your email address. I won't share it. It's just between you and me.</p>
                    <img  class= "bookImg" src="img/ericasparxZeroGravity.jpg">
               <p>Me, I've got a story for you. It's actually an excerpt from an unpublished novel about a guy and gal in space, but let's cut to the good part. They've been getting hot and heavy, and now it's time.</p>
               <p>Sex in Zero Gravity, my offer to you. Give it a read. It's five pages of clinging together while bouncing off the walls. It's a quickie. You'll like it. And you'll be on the list, so when I get a story out to Kindle Unlimited, you'll be ready.</p>
               <p>"Oh, hell, this wasn't high school She knew what that crescent smile meant. Tal wanted to get busy."</p>
               <p>So, let's get busy. Subscribe below and enjoy the story, avaiable in mobi and epub and pdf</p>
               <p>But I'll be publishing on Amazon, so get the Kindle app for your phone. I don't want to miss you.</p>
               <p>Luv Erica</p>

               <p>I know Erica has guaranteed not to go all stalker-clingy with my email address.</p>
               <p>Trust is so important in a relationship, don't you agree?</p>
